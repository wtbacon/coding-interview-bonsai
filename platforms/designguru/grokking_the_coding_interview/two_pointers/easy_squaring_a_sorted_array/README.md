# Squaring a Sorted Array

- Pattern: Two pointers

## Problem

Given an sorted integer array `arr`, return a new array containing squares of all the elements of the input array in the sorted order.

## Notes

- Time: $O(N)$
- Space: $O(1)$
- Approach: Use two pointers: one pointer starts from the head of the array and the other one start from the end of the array.
