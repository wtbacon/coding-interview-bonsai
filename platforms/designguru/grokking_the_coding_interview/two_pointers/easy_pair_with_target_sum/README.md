# Pair with Target Sum

- Pattern: Two pointers

## Problem

Given an integer array `arr` and a integer `target`, return a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

## Notes

- Time: $O(N)$
- Space: $O(1)$
- Approach: Use two pointer that start with one pointer `left` at the beginning and the other pointer `right` at the end of the array.
