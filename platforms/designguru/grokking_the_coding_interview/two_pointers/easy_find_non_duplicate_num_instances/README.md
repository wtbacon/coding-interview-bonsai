# Find Non-Duplicate Number Instances

- Pattern: Two pointers

## Problem (write in your words)

Given an array of sorted integer `arr`, return the length of an array that is moved all non-duplicate number elements at the beginning of the array in-place not to use any extra spaces.

## Notes

- Time: $O(N)$
- Space: $O(1)$
- Approach: Use two pointers, where one pointer iterates through the array and the other places the next non-duplicate number.
