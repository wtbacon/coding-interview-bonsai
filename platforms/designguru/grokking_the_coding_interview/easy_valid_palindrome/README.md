# Valid Palindrome

- Pattern: Array

## Problem

Given a string array `s`, return `True` if it is a palindrome, otherwise return `False`.
A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation and capitalization.

## Notes

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
  - If no additional data structures are used that scale with the input size, its space complexity is O(1).
- Approach: Two pointers
